# 289-Captstone-Project-and-Development
Hello this is the 289 Python Project and development Github. Contributions should be made on test branches before commited to the main branches please. Keep a report of any user stories and features to be implmented on the project board. Remember to save often and push your work on your branches often as you can to ensure you have the latest and up to date version of your code. Only move the project cards to done when a feature has at least been tested and working on all devices.


Put the templates into the approate folders so that way the code can work with one another. This way the Render Templates in the views.py in each seperate folders.
